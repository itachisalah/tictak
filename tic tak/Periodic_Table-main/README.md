# Python Periodic Table

Periodic Table - This is a Python project for displaying the periodic table of elements using the Kivy framework. The periodic table is a graphical representation of the chemical elements, arranged in order of their atomic number, electron configurations, and chemical properties. It is a long-form periodic table approved by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).



## Features

- Displays the periodic table with a detailed description of elements including physical and chemical properties.

- Click on an element to display its properties such as its electron configuration, atomic weight, and melting and boiling points and many more.

- Its data is taken from a Github Repository - https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON

- It can also be converted to an .apk file for an Android Device.


## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python packages:
